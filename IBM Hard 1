# Question:

IBM is working on a new feature to analyze user purchasing behavior for all Fridays in the first quarter of the year. For each Friday separately, calculate the average amount users have spent per order. The output should contain the week number of that Friday and average amount spent.


# Answer:

with recursive cte1 as (
    select 1 as week_number
    union all
    select week_number + 1
    from cte1 where week_number < 13),
    
cte2 as (
    select week(date) as week_number, avg(amount_spent) as mean_amount
    from user_purchases
    where dayname(date) = 'Friday' and quarter(date) = 1
    group by week(date))
    
select cte1.week_number, 
    coalesce(cte2.mean_amount, 0) as mean_amount
from cte1
left join cte2
on cte1.week_number = cte2.week_number;
