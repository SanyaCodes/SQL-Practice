# Question:

Meta/Facebook is developing a search algorithm that will allow users to search through their post history. You have been assigned to evaluate the performance of this algorithm. We have a table with the user's search term, search result positions, and whether or not the user clicked on the search result.

Write a query that assigns ratings to the searches in the following way:
If the search was not clicked for any term, assign the search with rating=1
If the search was clicked but the top position of clicked terms was outside the top 3 positions, assign the search a rating=2
If the search was clicked and the top position of a clicked term was in the top 3 positions, assign the search a rating=3

As a search ID can contain more than one search term, select the highest rating for that search ID. Output the search ID and its highest rating.

Example: The search_id 1 was clicked (clicked = 1) and its position is outside of the top 3 positions (search_results_position = 5), therefore its rating is 2.


# Answer:

select search_id, max(rating)
from (select *, 
        case 
            when clicked = 0 then 1
            when clicked = 1 and search_results_position > 3 then 2
            else 3
        end as rating
    from fb_search_events) k
group by search_id;
