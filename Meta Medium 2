# Question:

Meta/Facebook Messenger stores the number of messages between users in a table named 'fb_messages'. In this table 'user1' is the sender, 'user2' is the receiver, and 'msg_count' is the number of messages exchanged between them. Find the top 10 most active users on Meta/Facebook Messenger by counting their total number of messages sent and received. Your solution should output usernames and the count of the total messages they sent or received


# Answer:

with sentcount as (
    select user1, sum(msg_count) as total_sent
    from fb_messages
    group by user1),
    
receivedcount as (
    select user2, sum(msg_count) as total_received
    from fb_messages
    group by user2),

united as (
    select s.user1 as user_id, s.total_sent as activity
    from sentcount s
    union
    select r.user2 as user_id, r.total_received as activity
    from receivedcount r)

select user_id, sum(activity) as total_msgs
from united
group by user_id
order by total_msgs desc
limit 10;
