# Question:

Find the 3-month rolling average of total revenue from purchases given a table with users, their purchase amount, and date purchased. Do not include returns which are represented by negative purchase values. Output the year-month (YYYY-MM) and 3-month rolling average of revenue, sorted from earliest month to latest month. A 3-month rolling average is defined by calculating the average total revenue from all user purchases for the current month and previous two months. The first two months will not be a true 3-month rolling average since we are not given data from last year. Assume each month has at least one purchase.


# Answer:

select t.`month`,
       avg(t.monthly_revenue) over(order BY t.`month` rows between 2 preceding and current row) as avg_revenue
from
  (select DATE_FORMAT(created_at, '%Y-%m') as MONTH,
          sum(purchase_amt) as monthly_revenue
   from amazon_purchases
   where purchase_amt>0
   group BY DATE_FORMAT(created_at, '%Y-%m')
   order BY DATE_FORMAT(created_at, '%Y-%m')) t
order BY t.`month` ASC;
